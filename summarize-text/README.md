# Summarize-Text
## Text Summarization using HuggingFace Models
A description of the text summarization model can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/summarization).

This is an application that performs the text summarization model of a given text input, minimum and maximum length of summary.

The application takes following argument:
* First argument (Required): Text that needs to be summarized. Use '' for text length greater than 1
* Second argument (Required): Mininum length of the summary
* Third argument (Required): Maxmium length of the summary
* Fourth argument (Optional): Model name (default= 't5-base')

The container image can be found here: "docker://prithuls/summarize-text:latest"

For example, for the following arguments:
```
{
    "name": "summarize-text",
    "appId": "summarize-text-by-prit",
    "appVersion": "0.1.1",
    "execSystemId": "<system name>",
    "parameterSet": {
        "appArgs": [
            {
                "arg": "'The Tapis framework is an application programming interface (API) hosted in the cloud. Using Tapis, computational researchers can manage data and execute software on a variety of different systems, including bare metal servers, virtual machines (VMs) and high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.

            },
            {
                "arg": "5"
            },
            {
                "arg": "25"
            },
            {
                "arg": "t5-base"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The output is
